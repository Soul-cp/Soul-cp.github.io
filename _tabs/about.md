## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Hello, Iâ€™m **Irfan**. I mess with systems, break things (ethically), and play CTFs for fun. I spend most of my time digging into penetration testing and reverse engineeringâ€”basically figuring out how stuff works by making it do things it shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™m always up for a challenge, learning new tricks, and connecting with people who get the same rush from breaking and securing things.

## ðŸš€ What I Do  
ðŸ”¹ Compete in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges to test my skills and push my limits.  
ðŸ”¹ Dive deep into **penetration testing and reverse engineering**.    
ðŸ”¹ Share my knowledge by writing **technical blogs** on cybersecurity.  

## ðŸ“« Let's Connect  
Always up for a good cybersecurity discussion or collaboration! Hit me up on LinkedIn:
